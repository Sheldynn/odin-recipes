    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With this batch-style recipe, you won't have to worry about <br>
        cooking or cleaning dishes for days on end! As with any dish<br>
        worthwhile, it takes an investment of time and energy upfront,<br>
        but the trade-off ratio is much better than that of working 5<br>
        days in a row just to have two days off. This recipe asks you<br>
        of two hours max and saves at least triple that down the line.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In any case, it's delicious, budget-friendly, and ideal for inviting<br>
        friends over for a pierogi-athon! Encourage a pot-luck style approach<br>
        for trying different fillings. So many flavors work with potatoes!<br>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Dough:</u></li>
            <ul>
            <li>4.5 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 cups yogurt or sour cream</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li><br>
            </ul>
        <li><u>Filling</u></li>
            <ul>
            <li>5 russet potatoes, cubed</li>
            <li>add salt & pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1.5 cups sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li><br>
            </ul>
        <li><u>Add-Ons</u></li>
            <ul>
                <li>2 scallions, chopped</li>
                <li>4 cloves roasted garlic</li>
                <li>2 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
                <li>1 tsp Cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1 tsp Paprika</li><br>
            </ul>
        <li><u>Serve with:</u></li>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>scallions, chopped</li>
                <li>sour cream</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>In a large bowl:<br>
            Mix the flour and salt. Pour in sour cream, eggs, and 1 tbsp of water.<br>
            Massage ingredients slowly and carefully together until it becomes a<br>
            smoothe dough. It's okay if it gets a little sticky. Cover it with a<br>
            towel or plastic wrap while you make the filling.
        </li><br>

        <li>In a pot:<br>
            Pour in the chopped potatoes and add water with a pinch of salt.<br>
            Place a lid on top and bring water to a rolling boil over medium heat.<br>
    <strong>Watch the heat</strong> as you cook! Once boiling, you can remove the lid<br>
            and let the potatoes cook for 20 minutes, or until tender. You can test<br>
            them with a fork: if it pushes through like a bean paste, they're done!</li><br>
        <li>Drain the potatoes and add in the shredded cheese, salt, pepper and any<br>
            of the add-ons you want.</li><br>
        <li>Mash the potatoes with an electric mixer, or use two forks if you don't have<br>
            a mixer. Once the filling is ready, recruit some extra pairs of hands for help!<br>
            The shaping of the pierogi takes time!
        </li><br>
        <li>Flour your countertop generously. Cut the dough in half, keeping one half covered.<br>
            Flatten the other half with a rolling pin until it's about 1/8" thin. Using a cookie<br>
            cutter or a cup of about 3" in diameter, cut circles out of the dough.<br>
            <em>Note:</em> Put the scraps into the remaining covered half of the dough.
        </li><br>
        <li>Each circle of dough gets around <em>one tablespoon</em> of filling in the center.<br>
            Fold the dough in half and press the edges together. Lay the pierogi on a floured<br>
            surface and use a fork to finish sealing the edges. Keep going until all the dough<br>
            and filling is used up!
        </li><br>
        <li>With all the pierogi shaped and ready to go, bring a pot of water to a boil over high<br>
            heat. <em>Note:</em> Only add a dozen pierogi at a time. Let them cook until they<br>
            rise to the surface, about one minute. Use a spoon to collect the cooked pierogi<br>
            and cycle through the remaining batches (should be about 5 or 6).
        </li><br>
        <li>To freeze any leftovers, wait until they've cooled before putting them into a bag<br>
        and into the freezer. They should keep for about six months.
        </li><br> 
        <li>Optionally: you can fry the pierogi after they've been boiled. Melt the butter in<br>
            a pan over medium heat. Flip them over every few minutes until they're a deliciously<br>
            golden brown on all sides. <em>Serve</em> with scallions and a dollop of sour cream.
        </li><br>
