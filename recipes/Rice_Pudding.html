    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> <b>Rice pudding is so simple to make - it's almost as easy as cooking plain rice.</b><br>
            It's a wonderful make-ahead dessert if you have guests, and it can easily be<br>
            dressed up with berries, nuts, or Caramelized Bananas (p.177) [Leanne Brown]<br>
            has included a few variations, but please do experiment: Milk, rice, and sugar<br>
            are a great canvas. Try switching out the sugar for honey, or stirring in a <br>
            spoonful of cocoa powder, peanut butter, or coconut flakes. <strong>Serves 4.</strong></p>

        <p>Flavor ideas: Vanilla, Pumpkin Pie, Indian-Style.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup long-grain rice</li>
        <br>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <br>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <br>
        <li>1/8 tsp  salt</li>
        <br>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract <strong>or</strong> 1/2 vanilla bean, seeds scraped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a pot over medium heat and add the rice, milk, sugar, and salt.<br>
                Stir until the sugar is dissolved and then bring to a boil. Once the <br>
                milk is just boiling, turn the heat own to low and simmer for 20 minutes.<br>
                Place a lid slightly askew on the pot so the steam can escape.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Remove a grain of rice and taste it to see whether it's cooked. If it is <br>
                soft and chewy all the way through, then it's done. If not, let it cook <br>
                for a few more minutes. Once the rice is cooked, add the vanilla, and stir.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Remove the pudding from the heat and let it cool to room temperature. Let it <br>
                chill in the fridge for 2 hours before serving. You can also eat it hot, but <br>
                if you wait, the pudding will thicken in the fridge and have a more pleasing texture.</li>
            <br>
        </ol>
