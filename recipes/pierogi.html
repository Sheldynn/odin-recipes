    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>DOUGH:</li>
            <li>4.5 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 cups yogurt or sour cream</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
        </ul>
    <p>With this batch-style recipe, you won't have to worry about
        cooking or cleaning dishes for days on end! As with any dish
        worthwhile, it takes an investment of time and energy upfront,
        but the trade-off ratio is much better than that of working 5
        days in a row just to have two days off. This recipe asks you
        of two hours max and saves at least triple that down the line.
    </p>
    <p>In any case, it's delicious, budget-friendly, and ideal for inviting
        friends over for a pierogi-athon! Encourage a pot-luck style approach
        for trying different fillings. So many flavors work with potatoes!
