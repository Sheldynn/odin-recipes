    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> "<b>Bubble & Squeak is a traditional British weekend breakfast food</b><br>
            meant to use up the leftovers from the night before. Because it's<br>
            British, of course the recipe includes mashed potatoes! It's basically<br>
            a big potato pancake with stuff mixed into. Chop up any other stray<br>
            vegetables you have lying around.<br>
    </p>
    <p>     "The adorable name comes from the sound this dish makes in the pan,<br>
             the squake coming from the cabbage, which is the most common mix-in<br>
             for the potato. The method [Leanne Brown] is giving you is for one big<br>
             pancake, but you could make smaller pancakes for a neater presentation.<br>
             You can also forget the pancakes entirely and make a hash out of the mixture."<br>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup mashed <em>or</em> root vegetables</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the mashed potatoes and root veggies in a large bowl.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Sprinkle with salt and pepper and mix everything together 
                <br> into a big, thick kind of dough.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Melt the butter in a cast-iron or non-stick skillet over medium heat.
                <br>Add the mixture to the pan and press it into a flat pancake.
                <br><strong>Let it cook 5 to 7 minutes without touching it.</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li>Using a spatula to check the underside of the pancake, it is 
                <br>time to flip if it's a golden-brown color!</li>
            <br>
            <li>Let it cool for 10 minutes, then slice into wedges to serve.</li>
        </ol>
